- 👋 Hi, I’m Hope Townsend (@Hope2925)
- **WARNING**: A few repositories are private due to currently ongoing efforts yet to be published. These repositories mostly involve model validation and assessment for a Bayesian Inference model of nascent transcription, and algorithm development regarding using transcriptomic data to improve bacterial genome annotations.
- Some of my favorite public repositories:
    - IQ_Bootcamp_2023: To teach computational concepts to incoming interdisciplinary quantitative biology students (great resource for both newbies and experts)
    - Short Read Workshop 2023: 2 week workshop held by Dr. Robin Dowell & Dr. Mary Allen Lab for going over preparation, quality control, and analysis of data, most specifically high-throughput short read sequencing data (e.g. RNA-seq, CHIP-seq, etc.) [link](https://github.com/Dowell-Lab/sr2023)
- 👀 I’m interested in using and developing computational tools to analyze large-scale biological data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning techniques, algorithm development, and high-dimensional data statistics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any work that allows me to grow in the above.
