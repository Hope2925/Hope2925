- 👋 Hi, I’m Hope Townsend (@Hope2925)
- **WARNING**: A few repositories are private due to currently ongoing efforts yet to be published. These repositories mostly involve model validation and assessment for a Bayesian Inference model of nascent transcription, and algorithm development regarding using transcriptomic data to improve bacterial genome annotations.
- 👀 I’m interested in using and developing computational tools to analyze large-scale biological data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning techniques, algorithm development, and high-dimensional data statistics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any work that allows me to grow in the above.
